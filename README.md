# SmallSearchEngine
This piece of code uses an InvertedPageIndex to store the filtered data from the webpages. Some sample webpages have been
included in it for testing and an actions.txt file also has some "action/queries" that will be performed by the engine.
This also uses an AVLTree to store individual pagedata to fasten up the phrase queries for a page.
